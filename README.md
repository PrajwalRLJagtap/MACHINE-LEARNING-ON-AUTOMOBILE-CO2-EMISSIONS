Nowadays, one of the biggest challenges to face is the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) from the road transport industry as it contributes 80% of the global fossil fuel energy demand, due to its reliance on fossil fuels.
Vehicle manufacturers use standard, controlled laboratory testing and analytical procedures to generate the CO2 Emissions data that appear on the EnterGuide label for vehicles in Canada.
Here we have the dataset of new light duty vehicles in Canada from Natural Resources Canada , where we have a number of different Car models and their corresponding CO2 emissions when drove over Highway as well as on City roads.
Manufacturers use the 2-cycle testing procedure, by testing vehicles under simulated city and highway conditions to find out how much fuel they use and what will be the CO2 emissions.
We will be using this dataset to develop our Machine Learning Model
